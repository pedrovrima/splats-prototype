##  What is SPLATs?

SPLATs is a bird banding data visualization codebase, built originally in R, created to make a better sense of birds full life cycle. 

The original codebase required that the users had at least a minimal knowledge of programming and took hours to days to adjust all paremeters and get good enough visualizations.
